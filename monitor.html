    <h1>MONITOR</h1>
    <p>
      A monitor is an electronic output device that is also known as a video
      display terminal (VDT) or a video display unit (VDU). It is used to
      display images, text, video, and graphics information generated by a
      connected computer via a computer's video card. Although it is almost like
      a TV, its resolution is much higher than a TV. The first computer monitor
      was introduced on 1 March 1973, which was part of the Xerox Alto computer
      system. Older monitors were built by using a fluorescent screen and
      Cathode Ray Tube (CRT), which made them heavy and large in size and thus
      causing them to cover more space on the desk. Nowadays, all monitors are
      made up by using flat-panel display technology, commonly backlit with
      LEDs. These modern monitors take less space on the desk as compared to
      older CRT displays.
