    <h1>MOUSE</h1>
    <p>
      A mouse is a small hardware input device used by hand. It controls the
      movement of the cursor on the computer screen and allows users to move and
      select folders, text, files, and icons on a computer. It is an object,
      which needs to put on a hard-flat surface to use. When the users move the
      mouse, the cursor moves in the same direction on the display screen. The
      name mouse is derived from its size as it is a small, corded, and
      elliptical shape device that looks a bit like a mouse. A connecting wire
      of a mouse is imaginable to be the mouse's tail. Additionally, some of the
      mice have combined features like extra buttons, which may be assigned and
      programmed with many commands. The mouse invention is considered as one of
      the most important breakthroughs in the computer field as it helps to
      reduce the use of a keyboard.
