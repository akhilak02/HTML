    <h1>PLOTTER</h1>
    <p>
      A plotter is a type of printer that prints vector graphics. It is a piece
      of computer gear that converts computer commands into paper line drawings.
      It draws a line with one or more automatic pens. Unlike a traditional
      printer, a plotter uses a pen, marker, pencil, or other writing tools to
      draw multiple rather than toner. It may also use vector graphics files or
      commands to draw continuous point-to-point lines. Though it was previously
      widely used for computer-aided design, it is now only used to print hard
      copies of schematics and other comparable application.

      In engineering projects, plotters are widely used. Because they have the
      ability to draw continuous lines, whereas ordinary printers use closely
      spaced dots to conventionally drew lines. Plotters are designed in
      different forms, and they use different-different tools to draw lines on
      the paper. For example, a 3-D plotter (cutting plotter) uses knives to
      design any type of diagram or cut out a piece of material on the basis of
      given inputs from the computer. On the other hand, most of the plotters
      use a pen to draw lines on the paper. The object that is to be cut is
      located on the flat surface in front of the plotter. The computer forwards
      cutting design and dimensions to the plotter for producing an exactly
      carved design. Then, repeat the cutting process on hundreds of objects to
      produce identical copies of the same designs.
