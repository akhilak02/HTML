    <h1>PRINTER</h1>
    <b
      >A printer is a hardware output device that is used to generate hard copy
      and print any document. A document can be of any type such as a text file,
      image, or the combination of both. It accepts input command by users on a
      computer or on other devices to print the documents. For example, if you
      have to submit a project report at your college, you need to create a soft
      copy of your report and print it with the help of the printer</b

      >Printers are one of the common computer peripheral devices that can be
      classified into two categories that are 2D and 3D printers. The 2D
      printers are used to print text and graphics on a paper, and 3D printers
      are used to create three dimensional physical objects.
