    <h1>SCANNER</h1>
    <p>
      A scanner is an electrical device that reads and converts documents such
      as photos and pages of text into a digital signal. This changes the
      documents in a form that can be viewed and or modified on a computer
      system by using software applications. There are numerous kinds of
      scanners available in the market that have different resolutions. Most
      scanners have a flat scanning surface as they are flatbed devices, which
      are mainly used for scanning magazines, photographs, and numerous
      documents. Furthermore, because most flatbed scanners have a cover that
      lifts up, they can scan books and other heavy things. A sheet-fed scanner
      is another type of scanner that is only able to accept paper documents.
      Although sheet-fed scanners have no capability of scanning books, some of
      their models include a feature of an automatic document feeder (ADF) that
      allows various pages to be scanned in sequence. The scanner interacts with
      computer software applications to execute tasks. The data from the scanner
      is imported into these apps. Most of the scanners contain basic scanning
      software that makes users capable of configuring, initiating, and
      importing scans. Scanners are also able to import scanned images directly
      through various software. The software accomplishes this by scanning the
      computer's installed plug-ins. If a scanner plug-in for Adobe Photoshop is
      installed, for example, users can create new photos directly from the
      linked scanner. Although some programs like OmniPage and Acrobat can
      identify scanned text, the scanned images can also be edited by Photoshop.
      It is done by a technology, which is known as optical character
      recognition (OCR). Scanning software that includes optical character
      recognition has the ability to convert scanned text documents into digital
      text in a form that can be viewed and modified with the help of a word
      processor. Some OCR programs also have the ability to capture page and
      text formatting that led to possible of generating electronic copies of
      physical documents. Scanning is also the most dependable and
      cost-effective method of delivering images in the world of electronic data
      transmission.
